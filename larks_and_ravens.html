<h2>Larks & Ravens <small>(PCDC Footnotes May 2019)</small></h2>
<br>
<p>There is a movement afoot for contra callers to use gender neutral terms for dance roles. Perhaps you have already experienced a dance, an evening or a whole weekend of non gendered calling at Contra Remix, Next Gen dance camp, or Supersonic. On May 4th & May 11th, callers at Fulton will be calling “larks & ravens” instead of  “gents & ladies,” giving our community an opportunity to experiment with a new model and further community dialog about why and if we should pursue this evolution in contra dancing. The contra committee welcomes feedback from all dancers about their experiences at these upcoming dances. We will have surveys available at the dances. Additionally, please talk to us personally or send an email to pdxcontra@gmail.com.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What’s wrong with “Gents & Ladies?”</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous benefits of not adhering to strict gender roles at contra dances:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Transgender and non-binary dancers, and younger dancers across the spectrum, consistently give feedback that gender neutral dance terminology is crucial to creating a welcoming and inclusive community.</li>
	<li>Some people strongly prefer to dance one role and have faced pushback when their preferred role does not match their gender presentation.</li>
	<li>Injuries often make dancing one role preferable over another. By using non-gendered terms, dancers may feel more welcome to dance whichever role is more suitable for their body.</li>
	<li>A lack of gender balance doesn’t result in dancers sitting out when they would like to be dancing.</li>
	<li>Those who choose to try dancing a new role may discover that this new perspective makes them better dancers, challenges their brains and introduces them to new people.</li>
	<li>Communicating with your dance partner about which role you will dance begins a conversation that can continue about other aspects of the dance as well. Do you like to swing fast? Do you like flourishes? Do you have any injuries I should know about? etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For many reasons, our contra dances are seeing increased numbers of people who dance both roles, dance with partners of the same gender, and dance in roles that do not match their gender presentation. At “gents & ladies” dances, newer dancers can be confused by all this non-conformity as the terms “gents” and “ladies” no longer reflect the reality of what they’re encountering on the dance floor. The problem is not that a dancer is dancing the “wrong” role; the problem is that the term used to describe the role no longer represents the reality of the dance. By taking gender out of the language, dancers are freed from social pressure to adhere to one role over another, and far less likely to receive unpleasant comments from other dancers that they are in the “wrong” place.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>But Why “Larks & Ravens?”</strong></p>
<p>Larks=Left, Ravens=Right</p>
<p>As dance communities across the country explore this shift in culture, there have been a number of gender neutral alternatives proposed. The contra committee does not endorse any particular terms, but “larks & ravens” has significant momentum nationwide and for this reason, we feel it makes sense to use these terms for our upcoming non gendered dance. For now, we ask that deliberations about which particular non gendered words to use are saved for another time, as these opinions can easily derail the conversation about why we might consider shifting to non gendered terms.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Open Minds & Hearts</strong></p>
<p>Change can be hard, especially when it involves something near and dear to our hearts, as contra dancing is for many of us. As we embark upon this experiment, we kindly ask that everyone come to these dances with an open mind, an open heart, lighthearted curiosity, and a desire to challenge ourselves with something new. We will all make mistakes, and that’s ok! We hope that you will try it out, reflect on what it means to you, and contribute to the discussion.
